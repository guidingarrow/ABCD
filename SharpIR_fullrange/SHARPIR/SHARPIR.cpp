/* This function is currently only working for the Sharp GP2Y0A02YK0F sensor
 * which measures from around 20cm to 150cm. To adapt this to other Sharp IR 
 * sensors, you have to calculate the variables reg and exp.
 * 
 * To quickly calculate reg and exp, use microsoft excel to plot the graph 
 * provided in the datasheet. You should create a scatterplot (except that 
 * the y-axis is [cm], and x-axis is [V]).
 *
 * When you get the values, right click the line in the graph and select 
 * "Add Trendline". Select "power". Also, in the trendline options, check 
 * that you want to see the function. It will then be printed in your 
 * scatterplot.
 *
 * This is the function: Reg*x^exp.
 *
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * SHARPIR sensor(p20);
 * sensor.calibrate(57.373, 1.3166, 0.45, 2.5);
 * while(1){
 *     serial.printf("cm: %f ", sensor.cm()); 
 *     wait_ms(50);
 * }
 *
 * You can also use this method to manually plot values you've measured with 
 * the "volt" function, which in the end should give a result similar to the 
 * values provided below.
 *
 * Feel free to contact me with improvements for the source code, and
 * especially for values that would work for other sensors.
